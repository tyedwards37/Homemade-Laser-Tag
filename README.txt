Project: Homemade Laser Tag
by Tyler Edwards 
VERSION 1 COMPLETE 
VERSION 2 PAUSED

Description: A pair of 3D-printed laser tag guns that can interact with each other and emulate a game of laser tag.

*VERSION 1*
Software: Autodesk Fusion, Prusa Slicer
Hardware: Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, Button, AAA Battery Pack, Alligator Clips, Magnet Strips, Velcro Strips
Language: Adafruit Makecode
Material: PLA

Reason: Wanted a fun and practical project that would utilize my ability to design, 3D model, and program. Plus, I want more hands-on experience with the hardware end. 

Successes: I found very clear flaws that I can adjust for future versions

Setbacks: A lot, hard to access the inputs due to the placement of the support cross, gap between barrel and the transmitter made it very hard to line up, end of barrels didn’t print well and covered up the exit, button didn’t function as I had intended it to , two halves didn’t line up properly, design aspects had no indicators on where they were meant to go which forced me to eye their locations, epoxy and magnet strips both failed me respectively 

Learned: how to work in Adafruit Makecode, how to make advanced models in fusion360, how to take a concept then create from it 

Plan: 
        1. Work with an artist to design the guns' casing.
        2. Sketch out a basic blueprint with approximate measurements and spots for the internal hardware.
        3. Model both laser gun casings in Fusion360. 
        4. Slice and print the casings in their respective colors.
        5. Finish the print and make sure all the pieces fit together.
        6. Code the laser tag program in Python with Raspberry Pi implementation.
        7. Build the according to the code.
        8. Check if the hardware fits in the casing. 
        9. Redesign the casing, print, and finish again if necesary.
        10. Put hardware inside the casing and test the guns.
        11. Make any adjustments necessary and finish it!
