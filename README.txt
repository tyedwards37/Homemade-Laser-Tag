Project: Homemade Laser Tag
by Tyler Edwards 
FUTURE PROJECT

Description: A pair of 3D printed laser tag guns that can interact with eachother and emulate game of laser tag.

Software: Autodesk Fusion, Prusa Slicer
Hardware: Raspberry Pi x2, [ADD MORE AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH]
Language: Python
Material: PLA

Reason: Wanted a fun and practical project that would utilize my ability to design, 3D model, and program. Plus, I want more hands-on experience with the hardware end. 

Plan: 
        1. Work with an artist to design the guns' casing.
        2. Sketch out a basic blueprint with approximate measurements and spots for the internal hardware.
        3. Model both laser gun casings in Fusion360. 
        4. Slice and print the casings in their respective colors.
        5. Finish the print and make sure all the pieces fit together.
        6. Code the laser tag program in Python with Raspberry Pi implementation.
        7. Build the according to the code.
        8. Check if the hardware fits in the casing. 
        9. Redesign the casing, print, and finish again if necesary.
        10. Put hardware inside the casing and test the guns.
        11. Make any adjustments necessary and finish it!
